# Development notes
You need to register the app at [https://github.com/settings/applications/new](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

Once you have registered your app, you need to create a file named .env in your root folder. The contents of the .env file should look something like the following:

```
GITHUB_ID=PUT_YOUR_GITHUB_ID_FOR_YOUR_APP_HERE
GITHUB_SECRET=PUT_YOUR_GITHUB_SECRET_FOR_YOUR_APP_HERE
